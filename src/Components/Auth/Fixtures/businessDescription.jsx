      <dt>Text Editor</dt>
      <dd>Program that comes with the default installation of most computer operating systems that permits the user to save text to a file stripped of any formatting. Often used by web page authors, beginner and hardcore alike.</dd>
      <dt>HTML Editor</dt>
      <dd>Basically a text editor on steroids facilitating the writing of HTML source code by providing a graphical user interface containing buttons and drop-down menus that allow one to insert commonly used snippets of code.</dd>
      <dt>WYSIWYG Editor</dt>
      <dd>A program which permits the user to create a web page by working `&apos;`on top`&apos;` with the finished product as opposed to working underneath with the HTML source code (WYSIWYG = What You See Is What You Get). Although the easiest to use, WYSIWYG editors quite often produce bloated and junky source code.</dd>
